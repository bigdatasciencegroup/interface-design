            You will be acting as a content moderator by determining whether a post should be allowed, hidden, or blocked from the service.

            Please answer with your opinion, there is no right or wrong answer, and we will not judge you for your answers.

    <h1>Background on our research project</h1>
    <p>
        At the University of Washington, we care deeply about the internet being a safe place for all people.
        <br>
        Content Moderation is the practice of viewing posts on a open source site and making decisions about whether the content is safe for viewers. This includes blocking trauamtizing, racist, and toxic content (while still allowing users the most free speech possible). 
        <br>
        Content moderators are given the difficult job of going through millions of annotations a week, where they are given very little leeway for mistakes. These moderators are given very long strict hours without break in which they make these decisions, and many content moderators view so much violent and traumatic content that many employees are developing PTSD-like symptoms after leaving the company.
        <br>
        We want to see if giving content moderators the added support of a model's predictions can help make their work a little simpler. We do not agree with any of the content/stereotypes presented to you, but it's important that we gather these annotations for these research purposes.
        <h1>Data collection & sharing</h1>
        We will not ask you for your name, and the data collected in this study will be made unidentifiable to the best of our extent. We will securely store the data on our servers and only share with qualified researchers (e.g. who want to further the study of hate speech detection). If you later decide that you do not want your responses included in this study, please email so we can exclude your work.
        If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, or wish to obtain information, ask questions or discuss any concerns about this study with someone other than the researcher(s), please contact the University of Washington Human Subjects Division at 206-543-0098 (for international calls include the US Calling Code: +1-206-543-0098).</p>

    <div class="questions">
        <h1 class="titles">Questions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li> Would you block, hide, or allow this post? </li>
        
        We are trying to simulate the questions a content moderator would have here.

        <li> What would you flag in this post as offensive? (this will only pop up if you block/hide a post) </li>

        Content moderators must justify each of their decisions by pointing to where in the companies policy that content was considered inappropriate to make sure moderators are not violating user's right to free speech. 
        <br><br>

    <h3> Reflection Questions </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In your opinion, were the model generations helpful for making your decisions? Why or why not? </li>
        
        <li>Tell us about anything else you'd like to share. </li>
        
        <li>Tell us about your perceptions, opinions, and beliefs (this will remain confidential).</li>
        
        Answer a series of questions about your own opinions, perceptions and beliefs. Don't worry, there is no right or wrong! If you answered this question once, your answers should pre-load in subsequent HITs.
        
        <li>Indicate your gender, age, race, political leaning, and whether you identify as a minority (this will remain confidential). </li>
        
        Your own personal background and experiences influence what you think of as disrespectful or offensive. We collect this information to account for all types of backgrounds that MTurkers come from in our research. If you answered this question once, your answers should pre-load in subsequent HITs.
    </ol>
    
        <div id="content-warning">
        Content Warning: posts were found on the (uncensored) internet; while it's crucial for us to use them in this study, we do not endorse any of the stereotypes or offensive/immoral/rude material. You may find some of the content upsetting. </div> <p>If you have concerns, questions, or strong negative reactions to some of the content, please either email us (Maarten Sap at msap@cs.washington.edu, or Professor Yejin Choi at yejin@cs.washington.edu) or reach out if in crisis. </p><br>
